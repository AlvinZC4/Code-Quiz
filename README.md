# Code-Quiz

This is the Javascript coding quiz application.

This application quizes the user on their JavaScript knowledge by giving the user 75 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions.
Each time the user answers a question incorrectly they are penalized 20 seconds from the timer.  If all five questions are answered or if time runs out then the quiz will end and the user will receive a score equal to the time they had remaining at when the quiz ended.
The user will then be prompted to enter his or her initals in order to record their high score on the highscores page.
